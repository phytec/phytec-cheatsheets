Nano
====

.. note::
    Nano is not installed in default PHYTEC BSPs.

Nano is a simple text editor, which is often used by beginners and usually
comes with all mainstream Linux distributions. It convinces by its simple usage,
but it does not give you all the functions that :ref:`vi` offers.
When loading a file in nano like this

.. code-block:: bash

    host$ nano document.txt

you can directly take a look at its contents and, other than in Vi,
directly edit the file.  Also, all important commands can be seen at the bottom
of the screen at all time and a list with all commands can be seen by
pressing **F1 or Ctrl+G** .
**To save and quit simply press Ctrl+O <ENTER> Ctrl+X** .
Note, that the ^ before a command at the bottom line means,
that you have to press Ctrl and that button.
